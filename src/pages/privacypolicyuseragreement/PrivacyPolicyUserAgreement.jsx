            <p className="privacy-policy-text">HealForce (“Platform”) is a online health community that enables its
                members to share their data and experiences. This Privacy Policy describes how the information collected
                from users of the Platform, including individuals who have registered to join (“Members”), may be used.

                We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time, and without prior notice, by posting an amended
                Privacy Policy on the Platform. We will notify Members of changes we make to this Privacy Policy. We
                also encourage Members to review this policy periodically for any updates.</p>
            <h3 className="privacy-policy-subtitle">1. What Kind of Data We Collect</h3>
            <h3 className="privacy-policy-subtitle">Identifying Data</h3>
            <p className="privacy-policy-text">Data that is identifying or potentially identifying is treated as
                “Identifying Data.” This data includes:

                userID assigned by the Platform
                Platform password (this is collected as part of registration and stored as a one-way hash so that no
                one, other than you, knows what your password is)
                Name (Member may provide as part of registration or in a Member&apos;s Account Information)
                Date of Birth
                Email address
                Mailing address (may be collected via email, forms, or Private Message with HealForce staff as part of
                Member programs such as t-shirt giveaways and HealForce InMotion™)
                IP Addresses
                Geolocation data
                Private Message content for Private Messages between Members
                HealForce may de-identify Identifying Data. Once identifying information is removed, HealForce no longer
                treats the data as Identifying Data.</p>

            <h3 className="privacy-policy-subtitle">Non-Identifying Data</h3>
            <p className="privacy-policy-text">Non-identifying photographs
                Age (unless over 89)
                Location (city, state/province, country)
                Sex
                Gender identity
                Condition/disease information (e.g., first symptom, family history)

                Treatment information (e.g., treatment stop reasons, dosages, side effects, treatment evaluations)
                Symptom information (e.g., severity, duration)

                Connections to other people on the Platform (e.g., Followers, Leaders, and Groups)
                Free text entries, including forum posts, comments, treatment evaluations, surveys, annotations,
                journals, and feeds (collectively, “Free Text Entries”), that you make anywhere on the Platform, all of
                which is by default available to view by the public, including unregistered users (Please Note: If you
                include information that would otherwise be considered “Identifying Data” within ay Free Text Entries,
                for purposes of this Policy, such information will be treated as “Non-Identifying Data”)
                HealForce may aggregate or statistically analyze data, including from more than one Member.</p>

            <h3 className="privacy-policy-subtitle">2. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
            <p className="privacy-policy-text">All individuals have rights regarding their data. The European Union’s
                (EU) General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) describes these rights in law. They include:

                You have the right to request that your data be deleted. To do this, contact our community team.
